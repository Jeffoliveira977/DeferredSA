# DeferredSA

**DeferredSA** is an unfinished project with the primary goal of overhauling the graphical aspect of the RenderWare engine and GTA San Andreas. Currently, it is under development using DirectX 9 with Shader Model 3. However, there are future plans to port it to DirectX 10 and Vulkan for enhanced graphics capabilities.

## Project Features

- Advanced Shadows
- PBR Materials (Physically Based Rendering)
- Cubemap Reflections
- Paraboloid Reflections
- Spherical Reflection
- Post Effects (Bloom, HDR, Tonemapping, FXAA)
- Shading Effects (Cascaded Shadow Maps, Point Light Shadows, Spotlight Shadows)
- Normal Mapping
- Per-Pixel Lighting
- Realistic Water Reflection and Refraction
- Car Reflections
- Skinned Mesh
- Volumetric Clouds
- Volumetric Lights

## Project Status

I had to discontinue this project due to the significant time investment, with more time spent on reverse engineering than on actual graphics development. My plan is to resume work on this project once the [GTA reverse engineering project](https://github.com/gta-reversed/gta-reversed-modern) is completed.
